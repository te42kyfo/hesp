An incomplete list of open issues one might address sooner or later. Some of
them are also just fancy ideas.

- all OpenCL handles must be small enough to fit into the data cell of a
  SMOB. CL/cl.h declares them as pointers, so everyting should be fine. Maybe
  a configure check would be appropriate.

- install specially taylored callbacks by default

- Instead of copy rectangle, provide a cl-copy-array function that takes any
  array, shared array, vector or bytevector and moves it from/to a device.

- Image support is completely missing. This includes kernel arguments,
  samplers and all routines working on images.

- Write a ax_opencl.m4 to portably detect the OpenCL header and library.

- Provide examples

- Provide good documentation. Especially do I have to extract existing
  docstrings from my .c files.

- Implement event wait lists on all enqueue operations
