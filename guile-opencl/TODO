An incomplete list of open issues one might address sooner or later. Some of
them are also just fancy ideas.

- Many functions are still missing. Here is a list of mehthods that I still
  have to implement
  - All image and sampler routines

- install specially taylored callbacks by default in
  clCreateContextFromType
  clBuildProgram
  clCompileProgram
  clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback
  clLinkProgram
  clEnqueueNativeKernel
  clSetEventCallback

- Instead of copy rectangle, provide a cl-copy-array function that takes any
  array, shared array, vector or bytevector and moves it from/to a device.

- Check that all functions working on bytevectors work also on shared arrays

- lock host buffers that are targets of device memory

- Provide examples

- Provide good documentation. Especially do I have to extract existing
  docstrings from my .c files.

- Implement event wait lists on all enqueue operations

- Export the underlying OpenCL version as a guile variable.
