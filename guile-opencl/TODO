An incomplete list of open issues one might address somedays

- all OpenCL constants except the error codes are assumed to be cl_uint.  This
  is not true for cl_bitfield and cl_build_status. I should change this.

- all OpenCL handles must be small enough to fit into the data cell of a
  SMOB. CL/cl.h declares them as pointers, so everyting should be fine. Maybe
  a compile time check would be appropriate.

- install specially taylored callbacks by default

- substitute all methods that work on pointers, lengths and offsets with Guile
  bytevectors. Bytevectors can alias and have their length tracked and are
  therefore no downgrade.

- Instead of copy rectangle, provide a cl-copy-array function that takes any
  array, shared array, vector or bytevector and moves it from/to a device.

- guile-opencl should be a Guile module, not just global declarations

- Image support is completely missing. This includes kernel arguments,
  samplers and all routines working on images.
